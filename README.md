# Electron
The Second Installment in the Atom Series, a quick, easy-to-use canvas library

# What is Electron
Electron allows you to code in the canvas making your program easier and faster to code. It allows you to code canvas functions twice as fast like drawing a line with out all the hassel of writing beginPath(), stroke(),lineTo(), and moveTo(). Not only that but it has functions that aren't pre-built in the canvas like drawing fill/stroke triangles.
