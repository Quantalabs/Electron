# Electron
The Second Installment in the Atom Series, a quick, easy-to-use canvas library

# What is Electron
Electron is a JS Framework designed to make the canvas much easier. Normally, making a scene like the one below might take an hour or more, but Electron cuts it in half. With functions not already in the canvas, things like making a triangle in 6 lines to 1. Or making simple 3-d graphics like a pyramid or cube.
